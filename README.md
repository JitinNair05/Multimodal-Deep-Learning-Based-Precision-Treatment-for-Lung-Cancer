# Multimodal-Deep-Learning-Based-Precision-Treatment-for-Lung-Cancer
This project presents a multimodal deep learning framework for lung cancer classification by integrating CT scan images and clinical data. EfficientNetB0 is used for image feature extraction, and a neural network processes clinical features. Both features are fused to improve classification accuracy, achieving up to 96.86% accuracy.
